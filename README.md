# NoSQL-Social-Network-API

## Overview: 

I created an API for a social network app that uses a NoSQL database. 
<br>
The API can:
* create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database
* create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

## Technologies used:
  * MongoDB
  * Mongoose
  * Express
  * JavaScript
  * Node.js
